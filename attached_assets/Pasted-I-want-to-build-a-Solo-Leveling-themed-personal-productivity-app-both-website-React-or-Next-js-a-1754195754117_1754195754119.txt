I want to build a Solo Leveling-themed personal productivity app — both website (React or Next.js) and Android app (Flutter or React Native) — that acts as my personal goal manager. Here's what I want in detail:

🌅 Morning Routine & Notifications
Every morning at 7 AM, the app should:

Show the current date on top in a cool Solo Leveling font.

Prompt me with a "What goals do you want to crush today, hunter?" message.

Ask for my goals for the day via notification and open a goal entry interface.

Let me snooze or skip the morning prompt.

🗃️ Goal Organization & Categories
I should be able to:

Add goals under custom categories like: Training, Side Quests, Main Mission, etc.

Collapse/expand categories for focus.

Toggle categories on/off per day to declutter the view.

Tag each goal as:

Pending, In Progress, Completed, Failed.

Optionally assign difficulty or XP points.

🗓️ Smart Calendar View
A calendar interface should:

Show which days I set and completed goals.

Let me plan goals ahead of time (e.g., add something for 15 August).

Display each day's XP and streaks like a progression tracker.

Have a "Daily Dungeon Cleared" indicator if all goals are done.

📊 Personal Analytics
Track:

How many goals I finish daily, weekly, monthly.

Streaks of successful days.

Optional leveling system (e.g., Lv. 23 | Shadow Monarch, XP bar).

🔥 Interface & UX
Design in full Solo Leveling theme:

Dark mode with purples, blacks, and glowing neon blues.

Font, buttons, and animations like system UI popups from the anime.

Minimal but powerful — think RPG quest menu with cool status effects.

🔄 Real-time Sync
Realtime data sync between:

Android app and website.

Use Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.

Offline support: changes sync when back online.

✍️ Other Features
Ability to:

Set recurring goals (e.g., "Workout every Mon-Wed-Fri").

Receive motivational quotes from Solo Leveling before goal entry.

Set reminders for specific tasks/goals with optional voice notes.

Export data as .csv or .pdf report for personal tracking.

Backup & restore from cloud (Google Drive or Firebase Auth).

💾 Tech Stack Suggestions (Optional)
Frontend Web: Next.js + TailwindCSS + Firebase

Mobile App: Flutter (or React Native) + Firebase

Database & Auth: Firebase Firestore + Firebase Auth

Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Android, Web Push API for web

Design: Solo Leveling theme using custom fonts, animations, and icons

Make sure the codebase is modular, with reusable components for categories, goal cards, calendar, stats, etc. Also, prepare it for future scalability (maybe even a PWA version or iOS support later). Clean UI/UX with Solo Leveling-inspired aesthetics is crucial.
